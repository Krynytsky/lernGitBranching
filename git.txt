Hello everyone. Today I'going to improve my skills on git, with Learngitbranching.js.org
In this step I create new branch using the  ubuntu 20.20 terminal with below commands:
1. for creating new branch: git branch  newBranch1
2. For switching between branches: git switch newBranch1

In this stage we have alredy known how to merge two branch into one. For doing this use the command below:
git merge newBranch2Merge
